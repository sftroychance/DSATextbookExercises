# A particular numerical sequence is known as triangular numbers. The pattern begins as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, and continues onward. To calculate the next number in the sequence, we add the previous number from the sequence plus N, where N corresponds to the place in the sequence where the number lies. For example, the seventh number in the sequence is 28, since itâ€™s the seventh number in the pattern, so we add the number 7 plus 21 (the previous number in the sequence). Write a function that accepts a number for N and returns the correct number from the series; that is, if the function was passed the number 7, the function would return 28.

def triangular_number(num):
    if num == 1:
        return 1

    return num + triangular_number(num - 1)

print(triangular_number(7) == 28)
